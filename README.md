Assignment LLM for human-artifical agent interaction by Caspar Nijssen

In this repository, you can find the code and data to my Assignment LLM for human-artifical agent interaction about the Salesforce chatbot, as presented in class by me, Laura Hanning and Puck Kuijpers. The model should be able to run locally in a few minutes, which at the end allows for question-like input. The model will instantly generate an output answer.
